Step 1: Problem Analysis  
The goal is to design a safety system for a railway level crossing. The system must ensure that the gates close whenever a train is approaching or if a vehicle is still on the tracks. The gates should only open once it is completely safe, preventing collisions and protecting both trains and vehicles.

Inputs:  
Train sensor - detects when the train is approaching  
Vehicle sensor- detects if there is a vehicle on the tracks  
Timer - ensures that the gate remains down until the train fully passes  

Outputs:  
Gate position   
Warning lights/signals 

Constraints and context:   
Social: Must be safe for humans  
Environmental: Must with stand different weather types like rain, fog and heat   
Legal: Must abide by rail safety regulations  

Stakeholders:  
The railway operators  
Pedestrians  
Vehicle drivers
