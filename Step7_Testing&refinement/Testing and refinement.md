Testing  

Train = Approaching, Vehicle = None	- Gate Down, Lights ON	- Same  
Train = Passing, Vehicle = On track - Gate Down, Lights ON	- Same  
Train = Not Approaching, Vehicle = On - track	Gate Down, Lights ON	- Same  
Train = Not Approaching, Vehicle = None	- Gate Up, Lights OFF	- Same  

REFINEMENTS  
- The alarm for the vehicle on the track can be used to call the authorities if they are taking too long to respond.  
-	Have an extra set of batteries just in case the system fails, so there is an alternate way to ensure the safety of the stakeholders.
