Step 3 & 4 - Evaluation and Decision  

I decided to go with solution 2 because of its simplicity, reliability and safety     
- SAFETY: This solution accounts for the vehicles that might be trapped in the tracks, which allows for an easy escape for that stakeholder.  
- SIMPLICITY: This uses simple sensors and logic, which makes it easily translatable into a working system.  
- RELIABILITY: Ensures that multiple conditions are met before raising the gates, which means it considers all possible situations.
