Step 3 & 4 - Evaluation and Decision  

I decided to go with solution 2 because of it simplicity and a safety   
- SAFETY: This solution accounts for the the vehicles that might be trapped in the tracks, which allows for an easy escape for that stakeholder.  
- SIMPLICITY: This uses simple sensors and logic which makes it easily translateble into a working system.  
- RELIABILITY: Ensures that multiple coditions are met before rasing the gates, which means it considers all possible situations.
