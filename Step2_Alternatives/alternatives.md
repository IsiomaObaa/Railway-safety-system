Step 2: Exploring Alternatives  

Solution 1:   
Gate lowers whenever train sensor is triggered and stays down until train has fully passed and no vehicle remains on track.   

OR

Solution 2:  
Gate lowers as soon as train sensor is triggered, but also cross-checks vehicle sensor. If a vehicle is stuck on tracks, warning lights and alarms are activated until the vehicle clears.

Real World Example:  
In Nigeria, many railway crossings are still manually controlled. A railway staff member is stationed at the crossing and receives communication from the nearest station when a train is approaching. The gatekeeper then closes the barriers, often using a manual lever or chain system, and reopens them once the train has passed. While this system is low-cost, it depends heavily on human ability and attention and can sometimes lead to delays or accidents if communication fails. However there are some experiments happening in Lagos are utilizing semi-automated systems.
